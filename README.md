# CV Generator
## Motivation
Writing your CV is always a time consuming endeavour; for every application you need to tailor it so that you're making the very best impression for your intended audience. This results in many versions of your CV that can easily be lost, or no longer relevant. Unless the world was to do away with the traditional application process, job seekers are going to have to contend with the bespoke nature of applying for work for years to come - hence the existence of this project!

## Aim
Whilst this project is attempting to address the variability in someone's CV, it may have wider implications for writing documentation in general - I hope to someday be able to use it to efficiently write complex documentation without any GUI.

## Installation
```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
After installation, you can run the following to create a 'cv_bin' directory. Currently the application is reliant on this setup for now, but this is subject to change.
```
cvgenerator -init
```
